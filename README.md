# andrei.rm-r.org (réprise)

This is my new website. It is a fully static CSR app written in vanilla TS, using Vite as the bundler. Thus, building it is as simple as running:

```
npm install
```

to install Vite and other dependencies, then run:

```
npm run dev
```

to get the local development server up and running, and voilà!
