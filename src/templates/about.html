  <p>
    I'm Andrei Sova, an undergraduate student in The University of British Columbia. In my free time I like to write software, explore nature, language, and history.

    In the past, I have written many websites. This particular website is a fully static CSR (Client Side Rendering) app built from the ground up in vannila TypeScript. The animation in the background is made using three.js. The source code of this entire website is public <a href="https://github.com/AndreiSva/new-site">here</a>.
